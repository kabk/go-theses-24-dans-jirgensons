      <h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This paper is an exploration of the concept of an archive, the action of archiving and various differing perspectives on the preservation of information. Beginning by examining fundamental distinctions between different definitions of an archive, I go on to assess the intricacies of organising, storing information, and accessing it. Originating from personal experiences, such as organising files on a computer and an interest in understanding the instincts for saving, the research extends to several projects that concern different data. The exploration also contemplates the complexities of digital preservation, the significance of archives and the gaps within them, as well as their profound impact on shaping our perceptions of the past and future.</p>

    <div id="introduction" class="middle-column">
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>"Let us not begin at the beginning, nor even at the archive. But rather at the word "archive"—and with the archive of so familiar a word.”</em> This is the opening line of Jacques Derrida’s influential book “Archive Fever”. He continues: <em>“All would be simple if there was just one or two main principles.”</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Derrida, Jacques. Archive Fever: <em>A Freudian Impression.</em> The University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 1.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span></p>
  <p>The archive faces different implications, associations, and definitions, including misinterpretations to that of a library or a collection. Hoping to find a single clear thread of thought in the contemporary use of the word, as well as its historical background, I had no other choice but to surrender to the complexity of it with “Archive Fever” confirming my observations: <em>“It is thus our impression that we can no longer ask the question of the concept, of the history of the concept, and notably of the concept of the archive. […] Have we ever been assured of the homogeneity, of the consistency, of the univocal relationship of any concept to a term or to such a word as archive?”</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Derrida, Jacques.

  </span></span></span> it is as simple as the verb and the noun. “Save stuff and file it, or the place you put stuff to save it after you file it.”</span></p>
  <p>German professor Aleida Assmann likes to differentiate between two forms of archives – functional ones and storage archives.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Assmann, Aleida. “The Archive as a Laboratory of the New: Where Remembering and Forgetting Meet.” <em>Productive Archiving: Artistic Strategies, Future Memories, and Fluid Identities,</em> by Ernst van Alphen, Valiz, 2023.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span></p>
  <p>Functional archives store necessary information for action to be taken in the present, and within them, expiry dates play a crucial role. Both administration and political power rely on these archives. When the presence of an organisation, bureaucracy or political power ends, the value of this information instantly decays.</p>
  <p>Storage archives, on the other hand, operate on different principles. They come into existence when material that is no longer relevant for the present or future is set aside but not instantly discarded.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Ibid.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> Abbé Grégoire, regarded as the founder of the storage archive, in the late 18th century, introduced the term 'vandalism’.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> He argued that <em>“only barbarians and slaves hate the sciences and destroy the monuments of culture. Free men love and conserve them.”</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">To understand his choice of language with its divisive characterisation that oversimplifies complex societal dynamics and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, it’s important to recognise that vandalism was then viewed as a violation of the newly acknowledged global principle of respecting cultural heritage. (Assmann, “The Future of Cultural Heritage and Its Challenges”)<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span></p>
  <p>This era marked the emergence of a new cultural concept detached from the political. And, along with it, new civic values that acquired sanctuaries in new types of museums, archives, and libraries.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Assmann, Aleida. “The Archive as a Laboratory of the New: Where Remembering and Forgetting Meet.” <em>Productive Archiving: Artistic Strategies, Future Memories, and Fluid Identities,</em> by Ernst van Alphen, Valiz, 2023.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span></p>
  <p>My first exposure to archives was when my family bought their first computer in 2005. I remember using DC++<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">DC++ is a free and open-source peer-to-peer file-sharing application. Created in 2001, the program is still maintained, albeit in a slower speed and with no ambitious feature updates in the plans.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> to browse the folders that people were sharing and download any music I could think of, as well as the struggle when downloading films took hours, if not days. In Latvia, back then, the latest popular media, such as films, were available (if even) way after their initial release in other countries.</p>
  <p>Ever since, I have been practising collecting for future use. Whether it is music that I want to preserve access to and enjoy later, or references related to graphic design that may help my work practice, etc. Maintaining my archive, which consists of various collections, helps me retain information in a better way. It serves as a second brain, so to speak – a gut feeling that so often goes ‘Oh, I have this!’, because it is so easy to forget.</p>
  <p>I wonder, then, often, what is it that instils in me the deep desire to collect, to gather, to store, to index, to rearrange, to make all of these things <em>mine</em>... What do these acts of collecting for the future mean? This thesis is an endeavour to understand the processes of storing and saving, the love of collecting, safekeeping and sharing, between the general and the individual act, by navigating through the wreckage of data, files, folders and fodder.</p>

      <p class="noindent noindentmob">Both of the 20<sup>th</sup> century galactic archival endeavours can be criticised for their inability to create a truly holistic and inclusive catalogue. The Golden Record's contents looked, as Trevor Paglen puts it, like a kind of ‘it’s a small world’ multicultural utopia. “No images of war, poverty, inequality, environmental destruction.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-20" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">“Trevor Paglen’s Last Pictures.” <em>Phaidon</em>, 2018, www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2018/june/12/trevor-paglen-s-last-pictures/.

      <br />
      </span></span></span> The final version of the Pioneer plaque diagram exhibited equivocal symbols as well as sexual and racial bias. Even with Trevor Paglen’s own disc as an addition to this constellation of archives about terrestrial existence, it does not feel complete.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, these projects do mark a significant step in the discourse and prompt crucial reflections on how we describe and present ourselves and our surroundings, where political, societal, and technological landscapes are in constant flux, shaping our creations, our choices and influences.</p>

  <br />
  </span></span></span> It preserves traces of its past in the form of layers of sediment, fossils, and other geological formations. Also ecologically, the soil can serve as a memory of human extraction. These physical records provide valuable insights into the planet's long history, offering a glimpse into the forces that have shaped our planet's evolution<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">DeLanda, Manuel. <em>A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History.</em> Swerve Editions, 2000.<br />

  </span></span></span> and the traces we as humans have left in the past.</p>
  <p>Given its position at the core of our planet and its role as a repository of geological and environmental history, we can consider Earth fundamentally as an archive. Could we then label it as the default archive? And therefore think that the default behaviour of the Earth is to save, collect, and archive?</p>
  <p>From the moment we arrived on Earth, the innate act of preservation continued, with our primal urge mirroring the Earth's role as another, even larger container and collector of things. People were not merely hunting, but collecting in order to survive.</p>
  <p>American author Ursula K.

  <p>To continue this story, Sebastian Moss, a data centre journalist, elaborates: <em>“Most of what happened in the world was not recorded. Of what was, the majority has been lost in wars, fires, and through institutional decay, never to be recovered. Our understanding of ourselves and our past is told through what little survived, providing a murky glimpse that is deeply flawed and relies on the skewed records of kings and emperors.”</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-34" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Moss, Sebastian. “The Last Data Center.” <em>Data Center Dynamics</em>, 2022, www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/the-last-data-center/.

  <p class="noindent noindentmob">These gaps raise critical questions: whose voices are preserved in the records of the past? And whose stories are lost or obscured?

  <br />
  </span></span></span> by which we can understand the persistent influence of the past on our present.

  <p>Although who can afford to submit content to the Arctic World Archive? Interestingly enough, anyone can submit data for storage in the archive, starting from €99 for backing up 1 gigabyte of data for 25 years on a shared piqlFilm roll.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-50" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-50" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">“The Future of Data Preservation.” <em>Arctic World Archive,</em> 2019, arcticworldarchive.org.

  <p>The Arctic World Archive and its GitHub backup aren't just generating marketing buzz; their online presence and self-promotion feel too commercial and lacking in humility. There are advertisements of backed-up data from large institutions and even an option to have a ceremony for the <em>memories and information you contribute to the ‘World Memory’</em>,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-51" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-51" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Ibid.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> which some might see as overly commercial.</p>
  <p>This raises questions about accessibility: who truly has access to store their data in this archive? And should our limited backup space prioritise preserving NFTs,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-52" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-52" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">“Digital Art and NFTs Deposited for Eternity in the Arctic World Archive.” <em>Piql</em>, 2022, piql.com/de/nachrichten/digital-art-and-nfts-deposited-for-eternity-in-the-arctic-world-archive/. Accessed 22 Feb. 2024.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> among other things?</p>
  <p>On a personal note, my graduation thesis website is hosted on GitHub. With the backup not being up-to-date and with no assurance of updates planned for the near future, I worry about its preservation. Is my work a gap in GitHub’s backup?</p>
  <p>While the Arctic World Archive caters to those with financial means, the conversation around data preservation takes a different turn when we consider the internet and torrents.</p>
  <p>Torrents are files, that are constantly moving across a large network using the peer-to-peer communication protocol.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-53" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">“BitTorrent.” <em>Wikipedia</em>, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent. Accessed 22 Feb. 2024.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> In order to download a file, the downloading file segments must at the same time be uploaded to other users requesting the file. <span class="figure-indication" data-target="21"></span></p>
  <p>Torrents enable people to freely share digital files, making a wide range of content accessible to everyone. By bypassing traditional restrictions, like centralised servers, distribution control, paywalls, and geo-blocking, torrents create a more inclusive online environment where users can easily find and share data.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-54" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">It is worth mentioning, that torrents work on a slightly different principle than other P2P platforms, i.e., being more generalised and top down, they use tracker lists of available media.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> This sharing system ensures that content remains available to all, regardless of geographical, financial, and other<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-55" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-55" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Often, torrent trackers stand out as the sole online destinations where you can discover content that's both rare to access publicly and has been lost to internet decay.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> limitations. In a way, torrents are filling in the gap of the internet, granting access to otherwise inaccessible information.</p>
  <p>Of course, there is also the well-known illegal aspect of torrents. As Walter Benjamin once remarked <em>“You have all heard of people whom the loss of their books has turned [them] into invalids, or of those who in order to acquire them became criminals.”</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-56" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-56" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">Benjamin, Walter. “Unpacking My Library: A Talk about Collecting.” <em>Illuminations</em>, edited by Hannah Arendt, Schocken Books, 2007.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> This observation highlights well the lengths to which individuals may go to obtain content, emphasising its importance and the sense of necessity they feel. While there are legal and ethical considerations, access to information remains a driving force for many users.</p>
  <p>To not idealise torrents, it is important to mention, that they are still a very much curated archive and curating is never a neutral act. Even with decentralised systems, such as torrents, you are always dependent on specific files being available, as someone has to be sharing them at a given time.</p>

  <p class="noindent noindentmob">Let's introduce another aspect of digital preservation and sharing by discussing the program Soulseek. <span class="figure-indication" data-target="22"></span> This old-school file-sharing application, which has experienced a notable rise in popularity in recent years,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-57" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-57" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-content">“Soulseek Is Still Alive.” <em>Hacker News</em>, 2014, news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7398441.

Accessed 13 Jan. 2024.<br />
  <br />
  </span></span></span> Unlike torrents, Soulseek allows users to exchange music files only directly from one user to another. This organically direct exchange platform is gaining popularity for its simplicity in accessing individual collections of files. Whether you're seeking mainstream hits or niche tracks, SoulSeek provides a platform where users can easily download files without relying on their popularity or availability on mainstream channels.</p>
  <p>While torrents facilitate widespread access to diverse content, Soulseek offers intimate exchanges of files. Both of these systems highlight the strength of a networked approach in maintaining access to information and cultural, as well as digital heritage.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="middle-column">
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>What is the point of archives if there are gaps in all of them? If the narratives that are constructed in them seem so arbitrary?</p>
  <p>There are attempts of adding up to the galactic archive, and the attempts to create complete archives here on Earth, but no matter how much data you add to something, it will always remain incomplete. Imagine: even if you looked at The Earth from a spaceship, you could never see both sides of the planet at the same time.</p>
  <p>Could an archive ever be complete, as time keeps passing and everything keeps turning into history?</p>
  <p>Humans always try to make things a complete whole, but with all the things that we explore, there will always be something missing. When we attempt to achieve completeness, it only emphasises or even creates the problem of absence. It’s only total when everything disappears. Instead, could the Black Hole be the total archive?</p>
  <p>The point of an archive is to preserve valuable information and cultural heritage to the best of its ability using an index system. Striving to mitigate gaps by collecting and safeguarding as much content as possible, an archive is never complete and there is always work to be done, taking into account issues such as accessibility, limitations in resources, or the nature of digital preservation. Despite the existence of said gaps, archives still serve a crucial role in maintaining a record of our history, knowledge, and collective memory for future generations.</p>
  <p>Maybe the archive can only breathe if one acknowledges its flaws, the systemic failure that is inscribed within it, or maybe one day the archive will outdate itself and will become redundant.</p>
